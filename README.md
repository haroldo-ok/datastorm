Data Storm
==========

This is a Sega Master System clone of an Atari 2600 game named [Turmoil].

I had originally made the first, unfinished, version for [SMS Power's 2012 competition][SMSPower-2012], then now, four years later, I decided to resume development on this for the [2016 competition][SMSPower-2016].
